# cad2shpdll
a dll convert dwg file to shapefile(point and polyline)

In this dll,there is a function: 
    Cad2Shape(var OriginPath, DestFolder: string)
    
The function name is Cad2Shape
And there are two parameters,each type of them is string.

  1.OriginPath:means the cad file path(only dwg file type is supported)
  2.DestFolder:means the storage folder you will save your shapefile.
  
The function is a void function,if executed successfully,you will find your folder some shapefile.
